# GENERATIVE AI PROMPT INJECTINATOR

tooling to help create prompt injection tests for generative ai models and apps that consume their content

## RUNNING

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, and edit the variables for your environment
2. Run `docker compose up --build`

## GETTING THE OUTPUT
1. After running, get the container ID using `docker ps -a --filter "name=prompt-injectinator"`
2. Copy the output file from the machine using `docker cp ${CONTAINER_ID}:/app/output.txt ./`
3. Alternatively you can mount /app/output.txt as a local file volume

## Example

The block below shows output from the docker command line:

```shell

# TODO

* Allow for different tones of generation (eg. "angry", "appeal to authority", "emotional", etc.)
* Consider using a local file volume mount for the output (make it a dir so you can have multiple output files in the future?)
* Support non-OpenAI models for the paraphrasing
  - Gemini?
  - Claude?
* Support local models for the paraphrasing
  - dolphin?
  - mistral
